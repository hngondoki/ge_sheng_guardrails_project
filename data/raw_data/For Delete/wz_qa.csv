Safe Sex,,"Ok first, unajua contraception ni nini?

Contraception ni word ingine ya protection time ya sexual activity.

Wasee hu-use contraception ndio waenjoy sex wakireduce risk ya kupata ball🤰🏾. Kuna some contraceptives zenye zinareduce risk ya kuget/kutransmit STIs.
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) = infection yenye iko shared from one person to mwengine through sexual contact. Pia inajulikana kama sexually transmitted disease (STD).
STIs common unaezakuwa umeskia ni kama bacterial vaginosis, gonorrhea (kisonono), chlamydia na syphillis (kaswende).

""Kuna types mob za contraception, ni gani unaezataka kuskia about first?                                                                                                 

""Inaeza take some time kufind the right contraception for u, but ni worth kutry vitu different ucheki what works 😃.

No matter what u decide remember that condoms ni the ONLY way kuprevent both STIs and pregnancy 🤰🏾...ndio maana ni poa ku-use both forms of contraception: Hormonal & barrier (condom) kumaximise sexual safety""

The most important thing ku-remember ni ati uko na right ya ku-use protection.💫Pia naeza kukupatia deets za a friendly service wenye waneza kusort na contraception and advice.

""Condoms zinajulikana kama barrier method na zina keep the sperm from kuingia kwa the vagina🌺 time ya sexual activity. Barrier methods haziprotect tu msee from against pregnancy🤰🏿but... from STIs pia! Woohoo! 

Sexual organs zina-include penis🍆na  vagina🌺. Unaneed definitions?""
""The penis🍆 ni male sex organ. Ina-releases sperm during ejaculation💦. (Pia ndio inatumika kunyora but don't worry, hai-happen at the same time!😂)

Iko attached to the scrotum, (aka the balls). Scrotum ndio imeshikilia tesitcles zenye zimebeba sperms & hormones.""
""Mdame akiwa aroused, vagina🌺inaezatoa fluids kuprepare for sexual activity. Mara most hii huitwa 'getting wet'💦.

Msee ako na penis🍆, na mwengine ako na vagina 🌺 wakihave 🌺vaginal sex, sperm inaeza swim out of the penis🍆 na into the uterus through vagina🌺. Sperm inaeza fertilise an egg kwa uterus, na dame aget ball🤰🏾.

Both fluids zinaezabeba STIs. Meaning, saa ile semen from a penis 🍆 inamixes na fluids kwa the vagina🌺, kuna risk ya pregnancy🤰🏾NA STIs always."""
Safe Sex,,"❓Ok, unaezataka kuskia about the most common barrier method: the external condom?

""""""External condom inatumika kucover penis🍆 na a rubber-like material. Hii inaact kama barrier time ya kuengage in sexual acts.
Condoms zinakuanga effective tu kama ziko used vizuri...na zinafaa ku-usiwa everytime during oral sex, anal or 🌺vaginal intercourse.

But ndio ziwork lazima zivaliwe correctly.        """"
""""Top tips: kama ni old sana, inaeza break. 😔 Kama imekua kwa wallet yako for long, sare msee!🙅🏾‍♀️ Usitumie condom imepita expiry date. 

Kuwa careful usirarue the condom na usiitumie na maoils au lotions juu inaeza break hio rubber material. 

Tumia tu one at a time, na utupe after use 🚮Huwezi zitumia tena au kurecycle."""""""
Safe Sex,,"❓Unadai kujua pros and cons za condoms?

""PROS: Uki-use correctly, inakuanga 98% effective kwa kuprevent pregnancy. Barrier methods ni the ONLY contraception unaeza use kuprevent STIs. 
Zinakuanga available kwa clinics au chemists. Most importantly hazina hormonal side effects. WOOHOO 🎉

CONS: Ni must utumie kila time unahave sex. Meaning, kuivaa before skin-to-skin genital contact na kukaa nayo hadu umalize. 
Ni easy kuget the hang of them, usilet hio ikuput off 😀"""

Safe Sex,,"❓Would u like 2 learn about hormonal contraception now? (pill, iud, 🌺vaginal ring, injection etc)

Kuna types mob sana za  hormonal contraception kama the pill 💊, injection💉 , IUD,  implant na vaginal ring ⭕.
 A hormone ni chemical natural kwa body yenye ina play a role in sexual growth, development na reproduction.🌻

""Hormonal contraceptives zinawork kuprevent pregnancy 🤰🏿 pekee, si STIs. Ndio maana ni important ku-use condoms pamoja nazo 😃 Ikimanage hormone levels flani in the body, inaezastop an egg 🥚 from kufertiliziwa au ku-implantiwa properly. 

Most types zinarelease the progestin hormone. Wacha niexplain vile zinawork. 
First, tunaneed kubonga juu ya the Cervix , Vagina 🌺 na uterus""
""The cervix ni kama security guard ya reproductive system yetu. Inaconnect the  vagina🌺to the uterus. Opening ya the cervix ni REALLY small. 

The vagina🌺 ni ile part tube-like iko huko ndani ya the female body na iko covered na labia (🌺vaginal lips). Inaconnect the outside female genitals to the uterus. 

The Uterus ni the womb. Iko connected to the vagina🌺na a thick strong cervix. Madame na wamama wengi wako na uterus, but huwezi icheki from the outside. Hapo ndio watoi wanagrow in the female body.""
""Progestin huwa inathicken opening ya the cervix, so inamake that secruity guard so much stronger. Hii inahelp kuprevent pregnancy🤰🏿by kumake it really difficult for the sperm kufikia an egg ⛔. 

Progestin pia, inahelp kustop the ovaries from kurealease eggs (ovulation). Kama sperm haiezi reach an egg, hakuna fertilisation inahappen. Meaning hakuna mtoi. 🙅🏽‍♂️

Types zingine huwa zinarelease Estrogen. Hii hormone inahelp kuprevent ovaries from kurelease an egg kila month. So pia inaprevent fertilisation (kupata ball 🤰🏿)."""
Safe Sex,,❓Lots of hormonal contraceptions have the same pros and cons. Unataka kulearn about them?
Safe Sex,,"""PROS: 
1. Zinakuanga sooo convenient. Si must ukumbuke ku-do anything just before uhave sex.
2. Ukiziuse vizuri, zinakuanga very effective kukuprotect from pregnancy🤰🏿 .
3. Hormones hazi-limit ability yako ya kuget pregnant🤰🏿forever, ni only for the time unazitake.""

""CONS: 
1. They only help protect from pregnancy NOT STIs. Only barrier methods like condoms protect against STIs
2. Increased hormone levels can bring some side effects to our bodies. These can include mood swings, headaches, breast tenderness, weight flactuations or acne and pimples.
3. Hormones can also affect ur sexual desire.

Increased hormones can also affect ur periods. Sometimes it can help lighten ur monthly flow, but kwa wadau wengine, it might lead to heavier flows or 'spotting' (light bleeding in between periods). ""

""Hormonal contraceptives si 'one size fits all', sometimes ni must utry different ones ndio ucheki ni gani inafit best na body yako. 🤸🏽‍♀️🤘🏾.

Safe Sex,,"Vaginall ring ⭕ni ring hard full of both estrogen and progestin hormones na kawa huwa ni postpartum mums ndio hupewa. Ok, so inaingia aje huko?🤔

Well, ukitumia fingers zako, unaeka the ring in your vagina🌺na inakaa at the top karibu na cervix yako. Then ina absorb the hormones into ur body. Unaeza ichange every 3-5 weeks, depending on schedule yako (no more than 6 weeks!)

 Ukisha itoa, huwa inaprompt period🩸yako kucome. Ukireplace na a new one, make sure iko within the expiry date. Keep new rings kwa packaging yao until uko ready kuzitumia. Ukiwa unanyesha🩸, unaeza zitumia alongside regular tampons na menstural cups, no probs. 🙂"

Safe Sex,,"Intra-uterine device (IUD) ni a tiny t-shape plastic inaekwa ndani ya the uterus thru the vagina🌺kwa clinic. Sometimes inaitwa *coil* or a *loop*.

IUD inaprevent pregnancy 🤰🏿 but sio STIs. Depending on the type, inaezakuwa effective for 3, 5 or 10  years. Itnaezatolewa at any time at the clinic🏥. How cool is that? 😎A tiny IUD inaezahelp kuprevent pregnancy🤰🏿for years! "

""Unacheki,  madem huget p’s🩸for about 2-7 days kwa cycle.

Girls hukuwa the most fertile around ovulation so kujua safe days zako zinaezahelp kuavoid kuget ball🤰🏿.""
""Safe days 📆  huwa the first 7 to 11 days za cycle yako when uko least fertile (from day 1 ya p’s) but inadepend on how many days ur cycle is. E.g. Kama longest cycle yako ni ya 30 days, utaminus 30-11=19. So, count 19 days from 30 na utaget 22nd as your last fertile day and you can have unprotected sex the next day.🎊 

Kama shortest cycle yako ni 26 days, fanya 26-18=8. Count 8 from day one ya p’s uget the first fertile day ya cycle yako so unafaa kuget another form of contraception during that time ndio uavoid kuget ball🤰🏿.

Ps. menstrual 🩸cycle huchange sometimes juu ya many factors like travel or dawa so safe days only work cycle ikiwa regular.""

Ndio uweze kuenjoy safer sex, you gotta know the facts. Before tustart, niko curious ... Unajua vile STIs huwa transmitted?

Transmission ya STIs huhappen when certain bodily fluids💦zinamix time ya sexual activity, when genitals zinacome in contact with each other au through oral sex (kutouch genitals na mdomo).

Unaeza prevent STIs from kuwa transmitted by using condoms. Condoms huwa zinahelp by kuact as a barrier between the genital fluids💦including semen and 🌺vaginal discharge ndio zisimix.
""""That's why ni super important umake sure ume-use condom protection kila time unahave sex - hata kama ni with the same partner. Na hata kama ni 'just' oral sex. Ku-use a condom inaeza kuhelp kukeep safe!

Forms zingine za contraception kama the pill, the vaginal ring ⭕au IUD hazikuprotect against STI transmission. Condoms ni the only method inaprevent STIs. Do you want me to define sexual activity au genitals?""

""First, hapo kwa genitals, ni poa kujua regular signs za puberty ni gani. Time ya puberty, the vagina🌺hustart kuproduce a small amount of liquids or gelstimes different za cycle yako. Hio ni normal kabisa na inaitwa 🌺vaginal discharge💦.  

Kuna types different za discharge kama ile white or clear gel yenye hutoka as njia ya vagina 🌺 yako kujiclean. Clever, right?! 🤓 (Ndio maana huneed kuwash vulva yako na soap, it self-cleans!)""
Most 🌺vaginal discharge 💦huwa healthy but kuna zile si healthy. So unafaa kustart kuworry when? Ikiwa foamy, itchy, yellow, or yellow-green in color, ama iko na smell very strong, iinaeza kua STI or infection ingine. So keep track of any irregular changes kwa discharge yako. ⭐️
""Sasa tubonge juu ya STI symptoms zingine common unaeza look out for 👀.Burning when u pee, a rash or blisters or itching around ur genitals zote ni signs unafaa kutake note of.

STIs zingine hazina symptoms at all! Ziko invisible! 🤯Meaning, ni impossible kujua kama mtu ako na a positive STI status just by kumwangalia, you gotta go to a health clinic ndio ujue for sure!""
""Even though hatuwezi ziona, STIs bado zina affect health yetu 🤒 and zikiachwa bila kuwa treated zinaeza kuwa serious to the point of kutumake infertile.

Na juu msee anaweza kosa kujua ako na a positive STI status, anaeza pass it on to someone else bila kujua, by mistake!🤭""
""The best way ku-look after yourself ni kujua your STI status by kuenda kwa health clinic regularly.

Ni better kutreat the STI early ndio ikue less likely kukuwa long term consequences. The longer u leave it, the harder it is to treat STIs with medicine.""

Inaeza kuwa confusing ikihappen so jitrust, boo! If you feel like soemthing isn't right, see a doctor or a health professional akuhelp out. 

Babes, usijistress out ukiobsess over pregnancy symptoms ngapi zinakuanga, okay? It can get SO confusing 😖 Ushajua chenye nitasema, heri ufanye test ama uende tu clinic roho safi ili professional aconfirm for you. That way, no surprises! "

Pregnancy,Nitajua niko na ball how soon after nihave unprotected sex?,"Yaas,  Najua so many people wenye wanaezakua too nervous to ask this - power to you, mresh! 

Let's get into, okay?Itabidi uipatie around 6 - 12 days ndio ustart kucheki signs za pregnancy after an egg imekua fertilised. Around that time,  utaget a little bit of spotting, ina look like a period but less flow na a lighter colour 🩸 But that doesn't always mean you're pregnant FOR REALS

You know vile mi husema, the best way to confirm kama uko na ball ni kuget a test at a pharmacy or healthcare centre. So breathe, baby girl, you've got this.
Kama uko worried about pregnancy, the most important thing for you to know ni...use a condom Every. Single. Time."
,,
Pregnancy,Miscarraige ni nini?,"Whew, thanks for asking ❤️ It's so necessary kujua about this. Kama unaeza get ball, pia unaeza get a miscarraige. 

Hii ni when a pregnancy doesn't go through to full term, an embryo (a fertilised egg) or a fetus dies. Inaeza happen within the first 3 months of pregnancy.

Miscarriages ziko more common than we think na zinaeza happen for many reasons. Just because it happens, haimean huwezi get pregnant again, 🌺 It just means at that time it didn't work, okay?
""Remember, hii ni situation hard kugo through, boo. Unaeza kuwa na a lot of emotion and feelings msee akiexperience miscarriage. Kumbuka everyone may react differently. Kuna wasee watafeel grief na kumourn, and others may not need to.

By the way, juwa u can always reach out to a health professional or counsellor if you would like some extra support."""

Pregnancy,Naeza pata ball nikienda mechi for the first time?,"Swali noma! Kama ushaanza kunyesha (have periods) na hutumii contraception,  chances zako za kupata ball ni high. Kunyesha ni the body's way of telling you unaeza pata ball. Every month, an egg is released from the ovaries, which kama haitakuwa fertilised, itatoka wakati dem ananyesha.
Hizi tiny eggs zinaeza kuwa fertilised when sperm from a penis swims up the vagina and and meets it in the uterus (womb). Fertilization inaeza happen through unprotected sexual activity between a penis and a vagina. Kama unataka kuenjoy mechi bila kupata ball, option best ni kutumia CD (condom) na form ingine ya contraception kama the pill, IUD or injection. 

Kila mara ukiengage in sexual activity na mtu,  ni vipoa sana kutumia CD ili usipate ball ama kupata STIs. Contraceptives hukusaidia kuenjoy sex safely.  Kama unmaswali mengine pigia XXX 0800 XXXXX-free.❤️"
,,
Pregnacy,"CD (condom) ilibreak, sasa nitado?","Condom breaks zinaweza kukupea wasi wasi, lakini you should be proud of yourself kwa kututext kupata support. CD ikibreak wakati wa mechi, chance ya kupata ball ama kupata STI kwa sababu ya sexual fluids kumix hupanda. Lakini usipanic, kuchelewa doesn’t always mean unaball.

Periods huchelewa, hupotea na hurudi kwa sababu ya sababu mob kama stress, kubadilisha chenye unakula, growth spurts... anything, you name it! Kitu best unaezafanya sahi, ni kuenda hosi, clinic ama kwa daktari ufanywe matest kucheck STI na pregnancy status yako. You may need to go back kufanya tests zingine since pregnancy na some STIs can sometimes only be detected after a few weeks. 

""Ni vipoa kutake responsibility for sexual safety yako🙌. Next time ukitumia CD, hakikisha haija pita expiry date na pia haina tears ukiifungua. Pia, ungetaka kuconsider kutumia hormonal contraception na pia CDs kupunguza chance yako ya kupata ball. Unaeza bonga kuhusu contraception options kwa clinic ama na daktari.

Although inaonekana kama baba wa mtoi hataki kukubonga nawe, communication is key ili mresolve hii issue. Hig chance ana feel wasiwasi na anaogopa chenye itahappen next. Coming to a solution together means giving each other the space kusema vile nyi wawili mnaskia. Jaribu kuarrange kumeet na kuongea kuihusu tena. 

Wakati mkibonga, unaeza make enviornment yenu calmer kwa kumwambia kwamba unatambua vile anavyofeel. Ata kumwambia kitu simple kama 'Naelewa vile unafeel' inaeza saidia.🤗  Jaribu kucome up na suggestions za vile unatakaa kuprogress na ball. Kama partner wako ni aggressive ama disrespectful, si lazima uendelee kuongea. Kama ni safe, take a big deep breath in and out, and walk away. Kumbuka, reaction yao si fault yako.

Unaeza irudia hii conversation tena, baadaye, once you've both had time to digest how the other feels. Kama partner wako anaendela kuignore hii situation, jaribu kuongea na a trusted adult for support. Wanaeza kusaidia kuprogress na hii conversations. Huko pekee yako🫂.

Kuhave beliefs ni vipoa lakini lakini lazima umake sure beliefs zake hazitagombana na zako. Kama mpenzi wako anakupenda na anakutrust, basi ataelewa kama hutaki kumzalia mtoi, ata sahi. 

Decision kubwa kama hii should be made together and should be about what's right for both of you. Kumbuka, kuna njia MOB za kuonyesha mpenzi wako unampenda, kama kuspend one-on-one time naye, kuplan outings na pia kumwambia sabau ya kumpenda. "

Pregnancy,Kupull out:Naeza pata ball?,"Haya, acha ni break down pregnancy for you. Madem hurelease tiny eggs from their ovaries into their womb kila mwezi. Morio na dem wakihave sex sex, sperm can swim out of the penis & into the womb through the vagina. Kama the egg na sperm watameet, hii huitwa fertilisation. Kama the egg attaches to the womb, hii humanisha ukona ball. Kabla penis i-ejaculate, inarelease a liquid called pre-ejaculant or 'pre-cum', which has sperm cells. So... sex bila CD (condom) inaeza lead to pregnancy, ata kama a pull out aje 💦

Bila CD, kuna a higher chance ya kutrasmit STIs. Njia best ya kuenjoy sex bila kupata ball ama kutransmit STIs  ni kutumia njia mbili za protection: condom na hormonal contraceptives kama the vaginal ring, implant or injection. Pitia kwa daktari, hosi ama a local clinic kudiscuss the best options for you.

Ni vipoa kutumia contraception everytime ukienjoy sex. Kama unafeel comfortable, ongea na partner wako na umwambie hufeel comfortabe bila kutumia condom 😊. Hii ndiyo njia best ya kuensure sexual activity ni pleasurable na safe! Kupata more advice, unaeza contact XXX on 011 XXX, ni toll-free line."
,,
Pregnancy,Kupata ball ukinyesha 😲,"Yes, bado ni possible kupata ball ukinyesha. Kivipi? Well, sperm hueza kulive for up to 5 days inside you. So, kama ulihave unprotected sex ukinyesha, hiyo sperm bado inachance yakufertilize one of your eggs that release during ovulation.

Ovulation inahappen katikati ya menstruation. Uko fertile sana, siku ya kwanza ama pili after kunyesha, so either side ya fallopian tube inaeza release an egg, hii pia huitwa ovulation. Kama unaanza kuovulate a few days before having unprotected period sex, your egg could meet with his sperm - na unaeza kupata ball. 

Kuenda mechi bila protection ukinyesha, will also put you at risk for HIV or STI infection or kuinfect yule unayo lala naye. Advice yangu nikukuwa safe kila time💯 – tumia CD (condom) always. So then hutakuwa na wasiwasi ya ball ama kupata STI/HIV."
,,
Pregnancy,Nina ball?,"Kawaida, sign ya kwanza ya kukuwa na ball ni kuchelewa ama kumiss period. Madem wangine pia huexperience morning sickness kama kutapika ama kutotaka kukula vyakula specific. But huezi rely on hizi signs pekee. Way best ya kujua for sure for sure, nikuchukua pregnancy test.

Kama unafanya test kwa daktari ama nurse, atakuuliza maswali kama, 'ulinyesha last lini kabla uchukue hii test?'. Na kama tests zitarudi postive – kwamba unaball – utaelezwa vile utajitunza during the pregnancy. 

Pia, kuna option ya kununua a home-pregnancy test dukani ama kwa pharmacy. Hizi tests kawaida huwa reliable, lakini bado utahitaji kuenda kwa nurse ama daktari so that they can help you have a healthy and safe pregnancy and talk to you about your options. "
,,
,,
,,
Pregnancy,Unprotected sex ukiwa na implant,"Kuna chance unaeza pata ball, lakini ni ndogo sana. Implant inakupea 99% protection from pregnancy. Ina release a hormone into your body called progestin. Hii hormone hublock eggs zako from coming out of your ovaries na pia hu-thicken uterus yako to stop sperm from entering.
 
The risk of pregnancy also comes when the implant has reached its expiration date na hujaitoa. Usually, an implant should last between 2 or 3 years. After that time utahitaji kuitoa, uchukue ingine mypa. Kumbuka kukeep track! ⏰

The new implant itaanza kufanya kazi yake baada ya siku 7. Wakati huu, utahitaji kutumia CD kujiprotect. Kucheck kama implant yako ishaexpire, pitia kwa yule nurse ama daktari aliyekufanyia ile procedure. An implant only protects from pregnancy so always use a condom for STI/HIV protection."
,,
Pregancy,,Naeza pata mimba nikimpatia bj?
,,"Oral sex, kama kulamba lolo/bj haiezi kupatia ball. Pregnancy huhappen through vaginal sex or if his sperm finds a way inside your vagina while you're having foreplay. "
,,"Sperm ikicome into contact na vagina, kunachance itatravel to your uterus na kupatana na eggs zako. When hizi mbili humeet (egg + sperm), fertilization can happen, na hivyo ndivyo mimba huanza. Lakini babes, hii haiezi happen kwa kusuck mjulos. Ata ukimeza ukilmba mjulos, huko risk ya kupata ball. "
,,"Lakini, kupatia morio bj si 100% safe, bado unaeza pata STIs kama herpes, gonorrhoea, syphilis na pia HIV. Kupractice safe oral sex, ninasuggest utumie CD (condom) during oral sex kureduce risk of transmission."

,,"Nalove hii Q! Ni poa kujua what options are available to us when we're thinking about having sex 🌺 When people plan their sexual activity kuavoid their ovulation period, iyo huitwa the natural method. Juu hutumii any sort of condoms or hormonal contraception to avoid pregnancy."
,,"Form ya contraception yenye utachoose kuuse ALWAYS ni your choice! 

But you know I have to give you the facts. 
Natural methods hazikuangi as effective as contraception. The body isn't perfect, it doesn't always work the same, so you could still fall pregnant during your non-ovulation days. Sperm can stay alive and kicking in the uterus for up to 5 days🤯 Plus natural methods hazikuprotect from STIs including HIV😬"

Safe Sex,,Naskia aibu kuwa uchi tukihave sex.
,,"Sex ni big deal, na ni natural kukuwanervous about kuwaexposed that way. Ni normal kabisa! Lakini usijiekee pressure yakuwanaked in front of bae wako. "
,,"Mechi huwa tamu ukiwa comfortable. Bonga na bae wakokuhusu feelings zako. Kama anakuheshimu, atajaribu kuhakikisha unafeel poa na ukocomfortable pia. 🤗"
,,"Take time yako kukuwacomfortable na skin yako, skiza body yako, usijiforce kufanya chenye hufeel poa kufanya. Usikuwe na haraka, kuwacomfortable kwanza. Kwanza, focus on the mambo unalombotov kujishus with your clothes on. Twajua hii inaweza kuwa ngori, lakini growing confidence yako itakusaidia kuenjoy it more. 🙌"

Safe Sex,,Mbona sikubleed?
,,"Imagine, ni kawaida sana kutobleed after the first time utahave sex, saa zingine inahappen, saa zingine haihappen! Kama utableed, si noma vile huwa ni sababu ya kuwashwa kidogo ama kukatika kwa wall lining around the vagina. Hii huitwa the vaginal corona. Kuna shapes mob tofauti ya vaginal coronas, saa zingine the lining ni quite thick, ama thin... kila vagina ni vidifferent."
,,"Pia, hii tissue inaeza stretch naturally ama kuraruka kidogo wakati wa sports, ukitumia tampoon, ama kueka vidole ndani ya vagina. Hii sometimes huu coz bleeding. Kuna wadau ambao husema wanajua kama mtu ni vajo kama wanableed wakati wa mechi. Hii si true! Kama unableed ama zii, haimanishi kitu. 🤗 "
,,"Saa zingine kutakuwa na mapressure ya kuprove uvajo, lakini kusema ukweli, hakuna scientific test ku'prove' it anyway! Kama kuna mtu anakupressure kuhusu uvajo wako, labda wao si the right partner for you. Kitu important ni vile unafeel about sexual experiences zako. Kumbuka hii, ni body yako, so ni rules zako, wapenda wasipende! 💗"

Safe Sex,,Si get wet
,,"Vaginas get wet by producing their own natural lubricant. Sometimes it's a little and sometimes it's nothing at all - it varies! It doesn't mean anything is wrong with you or your partner. Usually, a vagina gets wetter when you are turned on which makes it easier for things to go inside it, to ease penetration. Sometimes it takes time to feel turned on, so foreplay or intimacy with a partner can help.  "
,,"You can talk to your partner and share what feels good for you, maybe it's kissing or a certain type of touching. A partner who cares about you will want to make you comfortable 💗. Going slowly and making sure you're relaxed are also important. You can use lubricant during sexual activity to help alleviate friction. You can get lube at pharmacies over the counter or at a health clinic. Remember to use a water-based lubricant with condoms as it won't damage the condom."
,,"If you're feeling discomfort during sexual activity, you should take a break. If you feel pain and it hurts, you should always stop. Sex shouldn't hurt and it's ok to stop and prioritise your wellbeing. If you're having pain during any type of sex that doesn't go away, visit your doctor or a health centre and they can best support you 🏥"
Safe Sex,,Naeza change mind yangu?
,,
,,"Hata kama ulisema yes kufanya something sexual (kama touching, kissing or having sex) unaright to stop at any time. Period!💅🏾 Hai-matter kama usha-engage in sexual activity once or 100 times before, your body is always your own. "
,,"Najua kuna pressure mob kuengage in sexual activity, but unaright ya kusema ""No"", ""Zii"", or ""Stop"" to your partner. They must respect your choice. Kila time unadecide kuengage in sexual activity, inafaa kuwa because un unafeel comfortable, respected na unataka kukuwa hapo.  "

Safe Sex,,Nataka kubaki vajo lakini nafeel pressured ya kuhave sex.
,,"Decision yakuhave sex ni personal sana. Kwanza, nataka ujue ni 100% natural kutokuwa interested na sex. During adolecence, hormones zako zitawasha feelings mpya mob including levels tofauti ya sexual desire. Kama utaact on hizi feelings or not, choice ni yako."
,,"Na-understand kunaeza kuwa na pressure kuengage in sexual activity. Ina feel kama kila mtu anaifanya. Lakini kumbuka hii, feelings zako na experiences zako zitakuwa tofauti from friends zako! U have to go with how u feel at the time na what's right kwako. "
,,"Kama unataka kungojea, hiyo ni 100% decision yako, na hiyo ni noma! Kama unafeel ready, make sure unathink about chenye ukocomfortable with na ukumbuke kutumia contraception. No matter what you decide, sex haikimbii popote, itakuwa hapo when you na future partner wako mtakuwa ready. 🤗"
,,
Safe Sex,,I know about cum but what's pre-cum?
,,"Before an orgasm, the penis releases a liquid called pre-ejaculant, which has sperm cells. When sperm from a penis meets and egg in a woman's uterus (also known as her womb) during sexual activity, this is called fertilisation. A fertilised egg can implant in the womb lining and a baby can grow, resulting in pregnancy. Because pre-cum has sperm cells in it, this is enough to make you fall pregnant if you are not using any form of contraception. "
,,"The best way to make sure that you won't fall pregnant is to use a condom or other contraceptives. There are load of different types of hormonal ones such as the pill, IUD or the vaginal ring. You can visit a doctor or a local clinic to discuss the best options for you! 🤗"
,,"Rememeber that a condom is the only method that helps protect from STI transmisison. Sex is much more enjoyable when you do it safely as you don't need to worry. For more advice you can also contact Love Life on 011 523 1000, it's a toll-free line. ❤️"

Safe Sex,,What's the right age to have sex?
,,People decide to start having sex at different ages for different reasons. So it's not easy to give you an exact age. Some people are guided by their religion or their culture. And others are guided by their own feelings and beliefs.
,,"But one thing is for sure for all of us- when having sex it's important to be responsible about it. This means making smart and safe sex choices, like using contraception every time you have sex or waiting until you and your partner both feel ready. 💕"
,,"It's important that it's your decision, based on your values, and that you and the other person both say ""yes"" to it. 🤗Not everyone matures at the same rate or feels ready at the same time. The right time to have sex is when you feel ready to learn about safer sex.

If you decide to go ahead, we can talk about your contraception options whenever you want.  When it comes to your body, health and wellbeing, you're in the driver's seat💖.

I can also give you the deets of a friendly service who can get you sorted with the right contraception 4 u, if you want?

Safe Sex,,Can someone tell if you've had sex before
,,"I get asked this question all the time. Fun fact: there’s absolutely no way for someone to be able to tell if you have had sex before.  You see, virginity is just a concept, there is no scientific test of evidence to be able to check it. Your vagina won’t feel different after having sex for the first time. What’s cool about vaginas is that they are elastic which means they expand during sex but then go back to their normal size soon after sex. "
,,"But what about the hymen? I'm gonna be real with you. The 'hymen' is actually referring to a vaginal corona, which is the wall lining at the entrance to the vagina. Everyone's is different it could be thick or thin, and sometimes has little tears in already, which might cause slight bleeding. It can tear any time in your life. That includes exercising, going for a run, or just your body growing! It has no relation to whether you've had sex before or not. It's just a myth. A stupid one at that. 😉"
,,"If someone is pressuring you to ""prove"" your virginity, have a think if they're really the right person for you. You have the right to choose if, how and when you might engage in sexual activity. This means it is your decision, made by you and you only. If you decide to be sexually active, make sure it's on your terms. Remember to always use contraception in order to enjoy sex safely. 😄"

Safe Sex,,Ouch! Sex hurts
,,"Ouch. Pain during sex is not cool! 😬. Some discomfort can be normal, but pain is a no-no. Let me run you through this in more detail. Since the vagina is a muscle, it can become tense if you're not totally feeling like having sex or if you're nervous before or during sex."
,,"If you're feeling some discomfort, you should take a break. When you feel ready, you can spend more time on foreplay; kissing and touching. This can help you to get more aroused and wet down there and also lead to more enjoyable sex for you. You can slow down, try different positions and most importantly - use lubricant! This can be bought at a pharmacy or clinic. Remember to use water-based lube as it doesn't damage condoms. "
,,"If you feel pain during sex, you should always stop. Sex shouldn't hurt and it's ok to stop and prioritise your wellbeing. If you're having pain during any type of sex that doesn't go away, visit your doctor or a health centre and they can best support you 🏥

If you want, I can give you more details on trusted clinics you can contact for more advice?
1. Yes please

,,"Go through a checklist: uko mentally ready? Uko comfortable na partner yako? Umefikiria ni type gani ya contraception ungetaka kutumia?  Sex ni choice yako always, na una-every right kukataa kama hufeel ready. Ni sawa kabisaaa not to have sex wiith someone, hata kama unampenda."

Virginity,,Losing my virginity
,,"Acha nikuambie ukweli. When, how and who utadecide kuengage in sexual activity ni upto you, choice yako. Naelewa kuna pressure ya what to do or what not to do ukihave sex for the first time 🤯 Opinions za watu ya 'making it special' or 'kumaliza na hiyo story' saa zingine inaeza kuwa too much kudeal with... Nkt 🙄 Lakini imagine, *the most important opinion* ... ni yako! 😄 "
,,"The best thing unaezafanya ni kujiuliza: niko comfortable?  Hii itakuhelp kudecide if and how ungetaka kuengage in sex. Skiza, sex inaeza bring up ma-emotions mob. Inaeza kuwa time intimate between watu watu wawili na kustir up feelings kama affection na mapenzi, na hata pia embarrasment ama regret. Ni vizuri kuthink about chenye unataka so utakuwa prepared for what might come up. "
,,"Kumbuka, sex si kama kwa movies, actually ni kidogo messy! 😂Kama wewe na partner wako mko comfortable na mnataka the same thing, inaeza kuwa really fun. Jaribu kubonga na partner wako kuihusu, na inaeza kuwa opportunity noma ya kuongea about any concerns or expectations ungekuwa nazo. Usijiforce, time bado iko na unamaisha yako yote kudecide vile unataka kuexplore!🤗  "
